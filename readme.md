# Python script with Selenium to automate how I order my prescriptions 

This is a simple script I created using Python and Selenium, for my own use to automate my repeat prescriptions order from my GP website.
This program would not work for anybody else as it is tailored only for my GP website and my prescriptions, but hopefully it will help someone else recreate something similar.
Of course I have deleted all my personal credentials and the actual website I control through this script.


Requirements:
* Chrome
* Chrome webdriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. 
    Then you need to extract the file and move it to a location that is easy to access, 
    and paste that location in the PATH variable in the program.
* Selenium > $pip install selenium
