## Python and Selenium script to automate how I order my prescriptions

This is a simple script I created using Python and Selenium, for my own use to automate my repeat prescriptions order from my GP website.
This program would not work for anybody else as it is tailored only for my GP website and my prescriptions, but I hope it can be a guidline and help someone else automate their own personal tasks.
Of course I have deleted all my personal credentials and the actual website I control through this script.


To run this program you need:
- Chrome(at moment of writing this scirpt, Firefox webdrivers do not work properly, but that might change in the future)
- you also need to download the chrome webdriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. 
    Then you need to extract the file and move it to a location that is easy to access, 
    and paste that location in the PATH variable in the program. You also need to install selenium with $pip install selenium  
- you need to install selenium > pip install selenium
